Aims and Objectives
___________________

The objective of this experiment is to:

* Understand simple one-time pad encryption,
* Understand key reuse attacks in breaking one-time pad ciphertexts,
* Understand malleability and bit-flipping attacks towards one-time pad cryptosystems,
* Understand the risks and avoid bad utilisation of strong cryptographic primitives.


Prerequisites, Equipment and Software
_____________________________________

To complete the exercises, the student will need to fill in parts of a few Python
scripts. Therefore, knowledge of the Python programming language is required.
